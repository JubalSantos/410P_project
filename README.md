Welcome to Mazemania!

# Description
Our project is a simple graphical game where the player navigates some type of maze to the finish line! The game will use graphical output to display the data on screen in a (hopefully) colorful and fun way! The game features four different mazes which will be randomly selected for the user at runtime. Navigate to the exit using either the arrow keys or WASD. if you reach the goal, you win!

# How to Play!
Simply clone this repository to your local machine, and use cargo to build and run the program. Then, use the WASD or arrow keys to move around the screen and move towards the goal!


Here is a rough prototype for a maze:
```
| ----------------------------- |
|  start  |                     |
|   |     |    -----------|     |
|   |        |    |             |
|   ----------    |    |------- |   
|         |            |    end |
| ----|  |------------|    |    |
|                     |    -    |
|     |---------   |       |    |
| ----------------------------- |
