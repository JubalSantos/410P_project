The name of our project is mazemania

Our project is going to be a game and tha name of the project is mazemania. The game will be in ascii art but hopefully towards its completion we will have better graphics. Its going to be a maze type game that is going to have different types of level that the player/user can play. When playing the player/user will have to go through a maze while also trying to 
stay alive since there will be enemies around that is going to try and kill the player.



The game would look somewhat like this

#| ----------------------------- |
